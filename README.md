### Hi, I'm Olena ðŸ‘‹

I am a skilled Data Engineer with experience in various projects, proficient in Python and Scala.

During my participation in Google Summer of Code 2023, I contributed to the development of a plugin for the Scala compiler, specializing in handling async transformations. 

I'm passionate about learning new things and always open to new experiences.
